      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>My name is Laura Silva. I'm a Lawyer and an aspiring Programmer. My journey in programming started by doing a web-developer Bootcamp. I'm still finishing the Bootcamp, but I can't wait to begin working on what I'm learning. </p>
      <p>At my "Clark Kent" job, I work with tax law and bankruptcy. </p>

        <h3>Legal Knowledge and Experiences</h3>
        <p>I chose law because I wanted to help people. I love to understand and solve all the legal problems someone can have in our modern society. After I graduated, I was drawn to tax law, mostly because you advocate against public authorities. I
          work years as a Lawyer, collecting experiences in legal consultancy as well as litigation.</p>

        <h3>Developer</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code to fill a void that I had been a lawyer. I learned that I wanted to be ahead of the problem before it becomes a legal problem. This is my main drive to learn more and more about programming.</p>
